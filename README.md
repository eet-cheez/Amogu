# Amogu

A self-balancing amogus robot that moves and play sound effects, optimized for maximum goofiness.

## Key Features
- Self Balancing: Equipped with gyroscope for capturing orientation, adjusts motors to stabilize
- Movement: Randomly moves and turns around, helping the robot to avoid seeming static
- Sound: Plays random, goofy, amogus-themed sound effects, because everybody loves them
- Humongous Gyatt: A ***MASSIVE*** caked up gyatt
- Detailed Feet: Ultra-hyperrealistic grippers ripped straight from Sketchfab
- Working Lips: Luscious servo-operated lips to rizz up the audience while talking

## Why?
While self-balancing robots are a common project, a goofy amogus shaped one is surely not. When making this robot, we constantly thought: "how can we make this project even goofier." Amogu serves no purpose other than to entertain, the true jester of robots. ðŸ¤¡
