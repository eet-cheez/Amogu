# Amogu

A self-balancing* amogus robot that moves* and play sound effects, optimized for maximum goofiness.

## Key Features
- Self Balancing*: Equipped with gyroscope for capturing orientation, adjusts motors to stabilize
- *Movement: Randomly moves and turns around, helping the robot to avoid seeming static
- Sound: Plays random, goofy, amogus-themed sound effects, because everybody loves them
- Humongous Gyatt: A ***MASSIVE*** caked up gyatt
- Detailed Feet*: Ultra-hyperrealistic grippers ripped straight from Sketchfab
- Working Lips*: Luscious servo-operated lips to rizz up the audience while talking

## Why?
While self-balancing robots are a common project, a goofy amogus shaped one is surely not. When making this robot, we constantly thought: "how can we make this project even goofier." Amogu serves no purpose other than to entertain, the true jester of robots. ðŸ¤¡

## * BUT.. IMPROVISED DESIGN
Due to *unforeseen difficulties with 3d printing*, we were **unable to print any parts**. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­<br>
Our actual Amogu is flimsy, made out of cardboard, and too unstable to properly self-balance.<br>
*But what do we have?* **it has a gyatt and plays funny sound effects at least!!**<br>
We really want to finish this project, but Undercity does *not* have enough resources for it.
